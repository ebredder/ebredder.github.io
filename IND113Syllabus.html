    Attendance Standard and Withdrawing from a Course
</h1>
<h2>
    PVCC Attendance Standard
</h2>
<p>
    Class attendance is an integral part of a sound academic program for most
    classes at Piedmont Virginia Community College. Class attendance
    requirements are found in the course outline, which the instructor provides
    to students in each course. Piedmont Virginia Community College students
    are expected to be present and on time at all regularly scheduled classes
    and laboratory meetings.
</p>
<p>
    Students are permitted to miss 2 classes in a given semester.
</p>

<p>
    Students who have missed more than the permissible number of classes may be
    withdrawn from the course. A grade of “W” will be recorded for all
    withdrawals completed by “Last Day to Drop a Course with a Grade of W” for
    the semester. Students withdrawn after this withdrawal deadline will
    receive a grade of “F” except under mitigating circumstances, which must be
    documented and approved by the Vice President of Instruction and Student
    Services.
</p>
<h2>
    Dropping or Withdrawing from a Course
</h2>
<p>
    It is the student’s responsibility to drop a course. This may be done
    electronically by logging into MyPVCC. To drop a course with a refund, the
    drop must be done by the last day to drop with a refund (1/30/20). To drop a course
    with a “W” grade, the drop must be done prior to the last date to withdraw
    a grade of “W” (3/30/20). Please consult the academic calendar for these dates.
    <u>

            http://www.pvcc.edu/academics/academic-calendar
        </a>
    </u>
</p>
<p>
    Per VCCS policy, a grade of “incomplete” is to be used only for verifiable
    unavoidable reasons when a student is unable to complete a course within
    the normal course time. To be eligible to receive an “I” grade, the student
    must (1) have satisfactorily completed more than 60% of the course
    requirements, and (2) must request the faculty member assign the “I” grade
    and indicate why it is warranted.
</p>
<p>
    It is the student's responsibility to request a grade of “incomplete” and
    initiate the process by scheduling an appointment with the faculty to
    discuss requirements for satisfactory course completion and consequences of
    failing to meet established deadlines. The official written request must be
    completed prior to the “grade due date” for the course.

<h1>
    College Policies (as stated in PVCC Student Handbook)
</h1>
<h2>
    Children on Campus
</h2>
<p>
    College facilities, including the library, cannot accommodate the care of
    children while parents are working or attending class. Since the college
    and its staff cannot be responsible for the safety and welfare of your
    children, you must make arrangements for them off-campus. Children may not
    be brought into classrooms or laboratories without permission of the
    instructor.
</p>
<h2>
    Inclement Weather Policy
</h2>
<p>
    PVCC remains open when primary and most secondary roads are passable. When
    travel to the campus is unreasonably dangerous the entire college closes.
    The website is the first method of notification, followed by local
    television stations, then local radio stations (both FM and AM).
</p>
<p>
    The following phone numbers will also have delay/closing information:
</p>
<p>
    PVCC main phone: 434.977.3900
</p>
<p>
    PVCC Inclement weather/emergency message line: 434.971.6673
</p>
<p>
    Due to the unpredictable nature of Virginia's weather, PVCC may be required
    to close or delay opening. If a delay announcement is made, that delay is
    based on an 8 a.m. opening time. In the event of a delay, you should attend
    the class that is in progress at the time you arrive at the campus. For
    example, if the college is on a 2-hour delay, you would arrive at the
    campus at 10 a.m. to attend your 10 a.m. class (not your 8 a.m. class.)

<h2>
    Emergency Notification
</h2>
<p>
    PVCC uses the e2Campus emergency text and email notification system to provide quick notification in the event of an emergency, including college closings and weather-related events. Users can have an emergency message sent to their cell phone or email address.
</p>
<p>
    PVCC’s emergency notification system will be used only for emergency messaging, college closings and class cancellations. It will not be used for general communications, and users will not be bombarded with extraneous text or email messages. There will be an occasional test of the system to ensure that it is working properly.

<h2>
    Academic Disaster Planning
</h2>
<p>
    In the event of a College-wide emergency, course requirements, classes, deadlines, and grading schemes are subject to changes that may include alternative delivery methods, alternative methods of interaction with the instructor, class materials, and/or classmates, a revised attendance policy, and a revised semester calendar and/or grading scheme.
