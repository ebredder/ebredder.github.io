							<h1>Letter to the Committee</h1>
							<p>Dear Multi-Year Appointment and Promotions Committee:</p>
							<p>Thank you for taking the time to review this compilation of some of the work I have led, in collaboration with colleagues, throughout my tenure to date at Piedmont Virginia Community College.</p>
							<p>I joined PVCC in August of 2018 as an assistant professor of Electronics. When I assumed this role, my objective was to rebuild the Electronics program and develop the Advanced Manufacturing program within the NSF Advanced Technological Education grant. In the three years since, the Technology Department at PVCC has seen meaningful growth. In my leadership capacity, I currently oversee 5 adjuncts, 3 lab technicians, 3 major apprenticeships, local dual credit and dual enrollment classes, online instruction and full cohorts of remarkable students who are pursuing associate degrees, certificates and industry credentials.</p>
							<p>I have spent much of my career teaching and learning in Career and Technical Education (CTE) fields. I began this work as a woodworking and computer-aided drawing (CAD) teacher in a New Jersey high school, immediately after completing my undergraduate studies. The experience I’ve gained over time, by virtue of the diversity of teaching and leadership opportunities I’ve had -together with the steadfast commitment to education and workforce development which has always anchored my vision- has given me the foundation necessary to create a program which supports local Charlottesville-area industry in multiple capacities. This program provides community college students with various pathways for career and academic success, and training on current technology and skills which forge community connections both internally and externally to PVCC. </p>
							<p>This portfolio summarizes my teaching experience and qualifications at PVCC and illustrates the leadership I’ve demonstrated in developing a community-driven, skill-based program. I hope that both my excitement for trades and technical development, along with my sincere enthusiasm for PVCC and this community, are clearly represented in this body of work.</p>
							<p>Please utilize the online resources I have provided in this website for ease of navigating portfolio sections. Highlighted areas include: college events, teaching methods and resources, program involvement, research and presentations, grants, student feedback, program enrollment and community outreach.</p>
							<p>To put it simply, I am deeply committed to this position and I look forward to continuing to build, grow and evolve in capacity – both individually and collaboratively. I am genuinely fulfilled by my role in helping others succeed in their studies and professional life. The creative aspects of building physical and digital projects within training on tools and machines has me highly engaged and motivated, which I have found quickly fosters shared enthusiasm with students and local partners.</p>
							<p>I hope that this portfolio provides some insight into the intricacies of this developing program, and its influence – both current and potential - on our community.</p>
							<p>Thank you again for your time and consideration. I am truly appreciative of the opportunity to share this work with the members of this committee, and am more than happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>
							<p>Sincerely,</p>
