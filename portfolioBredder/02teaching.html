							<h1>Teaching</h1>

							<p>I am a strong believer in experiential learning and advocate creativity. I believe my role is to foster this innate ability within each student through learning different digital and physical tools that enhance the way they interact with the world. Students in the classes I have designed and teach practice skills and utilize them in project-based modules that enforce these skills in a direct and interrelated manner. The courses are designed to build certain stand-alone skills, but each class has overarching themes that reappear to strengthen the correlation and usage of the tools. Students in these classes are preparing mostly for employment from a certificate or degree and work towards this during their time in the program. </p>
							<p>The <a href="https://www.pvcc.edu/programs/iet" target="_blank">Industrial Electronics Technology (IET)</a> and <a href="https://www.pvcc.edu/programs/manufacturing-technology" taret="_blank">Advanced Manufacturing</a> programs currently consist of 3 adjunct professors, a program liaison, 3 lab technicians and me running upwards of 10 classes per semester. The Computer and Network Support certificate supports 2 adjunct professors and 2 classes that correlate to IT and Computer Science degrees. Courses in these programs are beginning to build online presence, (ETR241, ETR203, ELE239) to increase accessibility for students who are working or are not able to take a class on a certain day or place. Each semester we are offering a minimum of 1 class online. I have built each of the course outlines, descriptions, skills, syllabus, projects and connections in the IET program. I have redesigned two classrooms into workable lab spaces that meet the needs of these diverse classes and industry including using and maintaining machinery like CNC mills and modern 3D printers.</p>
							<p>Feel free to look at the online, blog style posts for my students to have always on <a href="http://www.ebredder.org" target="_blank">ebredder.org</a> in order to keep up with class and have the ability to easily share with industry partners. This style of posting reaches a generation of students that prefer succint information (<a href="http://www.ebredder.org/archived/19sp/SP19CAD151.html" target="_blank">Spring 2019 CAD151 Complete Course</a>). In combination with the affordances of Canvas I am able to utilize multiple tools to reach a broad range of students.</p>
							<p>I have created many videos for these classes, in-person and online, to help build resources for students when they need to work in the lab or at another location. Here is an example of a video playlist I created on Youtube for the Engineering Drawing Fundamentals course in Spring '19: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJcB3ij-FnysKqGEcpdGce5Zg48RL3Wnq" target="_blank">CAD151 Playlist</a></p>
							<p>Each class has its own set of projects that are continually adapting to technology and skills needed in industry. Please view this introductory project, shared as an open source resource, that has gained success in learning how to use the laser cutter, 2D vector design software, soldering, programming and circuit design: <a href="https://github.com/ebredder/Solder-Exhaust-Fan" arget="_blank">Exhaust Fan Design PBL</a></p>
							<p>During the Spring 2020 semester we have seen tremendous growth in the program. I am currently teaching 3 sections of CAD151 to meet these needs and using 3 different software packages (Solidworks, Inventor, and Fusion 360) in each class per industry request. Check out the syllabus here: <a href="http://www.ebredder.org/CAD151Syllabus.html" target="_blank">CAD151 Syllabus</a></p>
							<p>As a result of these courses and myself receiving training, students are able to gain industry credentials including: IPC JSTD001 Soldering, Autodesk Certified User, Solidworks CSWA, Manufacturing Skills MT1, ETA Electronics Tech 1-5, COMPtia A+ and OSHA 10 General Industry.</p>
							<p>An overview of the program stands out on this unique program fact sheet for IET: <a href="https://www.pvcc.edu/sites/default/files/Industrial%20Electronics%20Technology%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">Fact Sheet</a></p>
							<p>As a result of each course students create unique portfolios to share their skills and projects to gain matching employment and have access to their designs and work in one organized space. Here are excerpts of one student's work: <a href="images\IND-251 Documentation.pdf" target="_blank">Student Portfolio for IND251</a></p>
							<p>In the Fall 2019 semester, our program held a community showcase to share all of the projects and skills of students and their learning. Over 50 students in 5 classes with 6 local industry partners were represented. <a href="images\IET showcase.pdf" target="_blank">IET Student Showcase Flyer</a></p>
							<p>I received the <a href="images\awardsProgram2019.pdf" target="_blank">Teaching Effectiveness Award</a> in Spring 2019 for PVCC.</p>
