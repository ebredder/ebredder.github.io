							<p>As Principal Investigator of the NSF ATE <a href="https://www.pvcc.edu/technology" target="_blank">Central Virginia Advanced Manufacturing Initiative</a> I helped create and develop the IET program. The <a href="https://www.pvcc.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Industrial%20Electronics%20Technology%20Degree%20Requirements.pdf" target="_blank">curriculum</a> was accepted through the Curriculum and Instruction Committee and implemented in Fall 2018. These classes and skills were chosen as a result of a variety of industry visits, tours and events. Each year we host a <a href="https://www.pvcc.edu/programs/manufacturing-technology/manufacturing-day" target="_blank">Manufacturing Day</a> event that has seen hundreds of high school students, a variety of community members, more than fifteen industry partners and PVCC's student body, faculty and staff members. This event is sponsored by local industry including a $1,000 student scholarship for the last 2 years, thanks to VA Diodes. We currently connect with an <a href="images\Advisory Board - 2019.pdf" target="_blank">advisory board</a> annually as a group and individually dependent on industry schedule. This project award is in the amount of $438,964 and will be successfully completed in Spring 2020.</p>
							<p>This past year we have built a relationship with Old Dominion University Mechanical Engineering Technology Program and designed a transfer agreement to provide multiple graduation pathways for students: <a href="images\2019-pvcc-industrialelectronicstech-to-met.pdf" target="_blank">ODU Transfer Agreement</a></p>
							<p>This summer our team completed requirements for G3 Planning Grant including <a href="images\PVCC G3 Engineering Technology Curriculum.pdf" target="_blank">curriculum</a>, industry visits and building capacity for a new stackable CSC. As a result of digital marketing we have received over 20,000 views on the above video.</p>
							<p>I developed a project-based learning module for the NSF LSAMP Grant <a href="http://www.ebredder.org/archived/19sp/summerSTEM/index.html" target="_blank">SDV class</a> where we designed and laser cut sunglasses.</p>
							<p>The IET program has VA DOLI approved apprenticeships with Siemens and <a href="images\Char Apprenticeship 1-Pager.pdf" target="_blank">Northrop Grumman</a> totaling 12 total students in both programs. We currently support a plan for Emerson workers and teach on site each semester since Fall 2018. They have built a lab for the students and purchase supplies. Two PVCC classes have been incorporated as requirements into their internal apprenticeship. Over 25 unique students at Emerson have participated in these courses. <a href="images\EmersonCAD2020_v2.pdf" target="_blank">CAD151 Flyer</a> for this semester.</p>
							<p>Emerson and PVCC IET program received the VCCS Creating Excellence in CTE Award in 2019: <a href="images\6-19-19-cte-awards.pdf" target="_blank">Business and Partnership Award</a></p>
							<p>PVCC hosts some major recruitment events for high school students including the <a href="https://cvilleinnovation.org/tech-tour" target="_blank">CBIC Tech Tour</a> and Choose or Lose where we have participated the last 3 years in newly redesigned competitions and current activities.</p>
							<p>Over the last few semesters we have hosted some engaging industry and community partners to share their work to the PVCC student body including <a href="https://www.pvcc.edu/sites/default/files/NRAOCDL-9.18.pdf" target="_blank">Dr. Bert Hawkins from NRAO</a>, <a href="https://www.pvcc.edu/sites/default/files/golara_-_women_in_steam_workshop_poster.pdf" target="_blank">Golara Haghtalab, PVCC Alumni</a> and <a href="https://www.pvcc.edu/sites/default/files/women_in_stem_speaker_series_jenny_chiu_poster_0.pdf" target="_blank">Dr. Jennifer Chiu from Curry School of Education at UVa</a>.</p>
							<p>As a program we travel regularly to host classes in high schools and have successfully taken over classes at Albemarle, Western Albemarle, Monticello, Murray, Charlottesville, Fluvanna, Greene and the Miller School to provide students with information about PVCC and lead a hands-on activity with them!</p>
							<p>Currently I am running dual enrollment courses with CATEC with SAF130, ETR113 and ETR114. I just finished running a dual-credit course for a local robotics team with a variety of high school students with CAD151.</p>
							<p>I have completed and updated all WEAVE requirements for Electronics, Manufacturing, Industrial Electronics Tech, and Computer & Network Support: <a href="images\Electronics Tech WEAVE 1819.pdf" target="_blank">WEAVE Report</a></p>
