								As I continue to build this program and its interface with the community I am excited to have a future place to really call home base in the coming Advanced Technical Training Center at PVCC. I have been attending all of the architecture meetings to make sure that the building meets the needs of industry and the growing program. I wish to update the equipment and make sure that the building has the appropriate requirements for future courses and training. As a result of this capacity and current growth over the last year, I hope to begin offering classes to students in the daytime hours. We currently fill our classes with students who work during the day or can afford to take night classes. Ideally, we can double the amount of students who are taking these courses by catering to another population of student. As we build partnerships in the area, Charlottesville High School has agreed to teach dual-enrollment courses for ETR140, IND103, and CAD151 as part of their Engineering 3 curriculum beginning Fall 2020. Albemarle County Public Schools has agreed to teach CAD151 in their Engineering Drawing classes across Albemarle, Western Albemarle and Monticello HS starting Fall 2020. As a result of the industry partnerships and the work provided by G3 planning we are looking to expand our curriculum to offer a Mechanical Technology and Electronics Technology track. These will provide stackable credentials for students to have multiple entry points within the programs. As the program continues to expand in this direction I hope to add another full-time faculty to pick up the workload and have ownership to share with me. This would help meet the needs of off-site courses currently offered, online courses and daytime courses and replace the inconsistencies of multiple adjuncts. Currently the work Katie Thach has done to grow the program as liaison is highly understated. She is a driving force in industry partnerships, student success, advising, event planning, outreach and grant completion. Without her, the program would not be reaching the success it currently sees. I would need to continue this grant funded position into the program and have a full-time program liaison to keep the progress and effectiveness of the work. As new industry partners arise, I wish to create more full apprenticeship programs that lead to degree completion. The current cohorts have been a joy to work with and provide other students with real work experience within the classroom. As the NSF ATE grant comes to completion in Spring 2020, I will apply for another NSF ATE grant the following semester to continue the funding and growth of the program.

								I have witnessed underserved populations in the area and have begun to make some friends within the LatinX communities like Southwood. I have a few students that do not qualify for the FAFSA and we have been able to find donors for their entire education. I would like this to be a regular practice. I see many potential students that could change the program and become impressive local employees that break their poverty cycles. I am just experiencing the beginning of 2 students' success and wish to create a stronger method of onboarding these students. I also noticed many of the working students have their companies pay for their education, but their hours are not shifted at work. I wish to work with local employers to build awareness around the importance of the students' education and how it will influence the work they do in the longer term at the company and community. </p>

									Amongst all the books I wish to read and the tools I want to play with, I'd like to take a traditional machining course. I want to implement these skills into the courses and have the equipment available, but I also am just dying to learn more from experienced machinists. I want to do the same with aluminum TIG welding as it is not a strength of mine because of experience and time spent. There are local weekend classes that offer both of these services and I hope to take these classes to further my own personal skillset which always translates positively in the classroom. I am hoping to soon obtain a PhD in Computer and Electrical Engineering. I have taken an FPGA programming graduate course at UVa and would like to conitnue further towards an eventual terminal degree.

								Thank you for taking the time to make it this far in my portfolio. I hope that my future at PVCC continues to strengthen as I am lucky to be surrounded by good people, fun challenges and creative problems that fit with my passions.
